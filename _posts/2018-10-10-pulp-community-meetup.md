The first Pulp Community Meetup is going to take place on Tuesday, October 23, 2018 in the
Raleigh, NC area. The plan is to get together from 17:30 to 19:30 EDT. We don't have a specific
agenda. We want to use this as an opportunity for Pulp users and developers to get together and
discuss Pulp and it's ecosystem. The specific location will be announced closer to the date.
Please email your suggestions for a location to dkliban \[at\] redhat \[dot\] com.
