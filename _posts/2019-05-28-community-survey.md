Today we are asking for community feedback in our second Pulp Community Survey. [The feedback we got
in our first community survey](https://pulpproject.org/2017/08/08/community-survey-results/)
provided valuable insights into how our users use Pulp. For our second Community Survey, we hope to
also get feedback into how we can improve the upcoming Pulp 3 release from users, contributors, and
other community members.

We're giving away Pulp gear (t-shirt, socks, stickers, etc) to anyone who fills out the survey.
However, more importantly, by filling out the survey, you'll help us to improve Pulp. So if you have
ten minutes, please visit the link below to fill out the survey.
